# Google-Data Analyst Capstone

#**Quick Intro**
This case study is to verify my learning steps for the last two months of studying in the [Data Analyst course](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/V7TM6D7878JB).

**Scenario**
I'm a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The marketing team is trying to design a marketing campaign that can convert casual riders to annual members. The goal is to find out user behavior and develop our membership strategy of converting casual users become members.

**Ask**
Before starting, to find a way, I need to ask the leader these questions.
1.How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2.Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

**Prepare**
To find out user behavior between these two types of causal users and members. It needs to identify the time they use, their site, and the kinds of bikes they ride in the data. Gain insight into user behavior's patterns;the marketing can follow up to make suitable promotions and marketing campaigns. 

With download the data of information as following:

Unique id for each ride
Type of bikes (classic, electric)
When the ride started
When the ride ended
Where the ride started
Where the ride ended
Whether is a member or a casual user
Ps. With download the data according to the data [license agreement](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

**Process**
In the data clean phase, I use the R language to clean up the null values and unnecessary data. Since the limitation of my computer, I decided to export the clean data sets for further inspection. But this is not a necessary step for everyone.

**Analyze**
It would be much convenient to identify data when converting the raw data into months, weeks, and riding length for further analysis. I use the R language to do so.

**Share**
The proportion of users in the last year, the majority are members. Casual users are approximately half of the number of members.

**Act**
To summarize, all possible campaign suggestions are:

1.Promote according to the popular months, and put on advertising.
2.Promote the two-day ticket or time-reward membership program to attract sign-up for members during the holiday period.
3.Follow-up suggestions can be plans survey to understand their choice between classic bikes and electronic bikes.
